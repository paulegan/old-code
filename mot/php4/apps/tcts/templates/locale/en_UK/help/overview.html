<p>
 The Transaction Center Tracking System (TCTS) is used to track the status of
 transactions within different transaction centres.  Each user of the system
 has access to a certain set of operations for each centre.
</p>

<p>
 At the top of each page in the system, a drop-down menu is provided to access
 those operations the user has permission to access.  If the user has access to
 more than one transaction centre, a menu is provided for that also.
</p>

<p>
 To access a particular section of the system, simply select an item in one of the
 lists and the page will be refreshed to display the selected item.  The items in
 the lists may change as you move around the system.  For example a user may
 have "view" privileges over all centres but "submit batch" for only one centre.
 In this case the centre list will not be displayed on the batch submission page
 but will be shown on the search form.
</p>

<p>
 The language used within the application may change as you select a new transaction
 centre.  The contents of certain drop-down lists may also change, e.g. transaction
 types on the create form.
</p>

<p>
 To perform an operation on a transaction that already exists, you must first
 select view from the operation menu and then use the search form/results page
 to display the details for the transaction.
</p>

<p>
 All users will have "help" &amp; "logout" available to them in the operation list.
 Selecting "help" opens a new window with information appropriate to the current
 operation.  The "logout" option will log the user out of the system and return to
 the login page.
