Here's an example DTS template using INI parameters.  The
file contains just one package with a "copy objects" task.
To open, right click on DTS in EM, select All Tasks and
Open Template.  The idea is that a developer edits the
copy object task and selects the tables to be copied.  They
will have to enter the connection details for their local
database to do so.  These connection parameters will be
overwritten by the values in the INI file when the package
is executed.  One feature thats a bit annoying is that the
location of the INI file is hard-coded in the package
(currently set to C:\dts_props.ini).
