This is the source location for all WDIG perl development.

The "WDIG" dir contains the source for WDIG modules & scripts.

Use the "createStub" script to start a new project.  

The "make_all" script makes all the WDIG stuff in one go.
e.g. "./make_all PREFIX=/share install"

"CPAN" contains a local version of CPAN, used for installing
perl stuff - particularly WDIG modules.  See "CPAN/README".
