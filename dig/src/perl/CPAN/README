This is a local copy of CPAN with the packages necessary 
to install WDIG stuff.

The "local" directory contains the package archives and
indexes in much the same structure as on a CPAN mirror.

The file "modules/02packages.details.txt.gz" contains the
index of packages with version numbers and archive file
locations.

To use this CPAN copy ensure that $CPAN::Config->{urllist}
points to the "local" dir.  One way to do this is to use
the "cpan_shell" script in this directory which will start
CPAN with the "Config.pm" also provided.

The WDIG packages are stored in authors/id/W/WD/WDIG.

To install all WDIG packages, use the bundle:
perl -I /share/src/perl -MCPAN -e "install Bundle::WDIG"

If you update a package you must also update the CHECKSUMS
file by using the "update_checksums" script.

If you add a new package (or create one with a new version)
then you must update the package index with the 
"make_package_list" script.

If you want to update a package from the real CPAN, try
something like this:
./cpan_shell
cpan> o conf urllist = http://funet.fi/pub/CPAN
cpan> reload index
cpan> get my::new::package
cpan> exit
./restore_package_list
./make_package_list local/authors | gzip -c \
   > local/modules/02packages.details.txt.gz

XML::Parser 2.31 and XML::SAX::Expat 0.35 are not as on CPAN 
but patched.  The patches are in the "modules" dir.
