Instructions for installing the SWID Cookie filter/logger
======================================================================

Shared Library
------------------------------

	The shared library for this component should go into a directory
called shlib in the Netscape Enterprise Server home directory.  For
instance if the NES home is in /opt/suitespot, then we need have the
shared library go into the following directory:

/opt/suitespot/shlib/DOLSwidCookie.so



obj.conf Changes
------------------------------

The following changes need to be made in the obj.conf:

1. Add an entry for the Init loader for the routine.  This should go
near the top of the file:

Init fn="load-modules" shlib="/opt/suitespot/shlib/DOLSwidCookie.so" \
	funcs="DOLSwidCookie-init,DOLSwidCookie-service,DOLSwidCookie-log"

Init fn="DOLSwidCookie-init" server-name="SERVERNAME" server-ip="127.0.0.1" \
	debug=1 debug-log-name="/opt/suitespot/https-SERVERNAME/logs/swid_cookie_debug.log" \
	cookie-name="SWID" cookie-expires="10" cookie-domain=".go.com" \
	log-name="/opt/suitespot/https-SERVERNAME/logs/swid_cookie.log"

Note that this has to be a single line.

The server-name parameter should be set to the name that needs to
appear as the servername in the swid log file.  The server-ip
parameter needs to be set to the ip address of the server.  The debug
parameter can be set to 0.  Note that if debugging is on, there will
be a lot of log entries generated.  The cookie name can stay the same.
The cookie-expires parameter is the number of seconds for which the
cookie will be valid.  This needs to be set to a value resembling the
same behaviour in the current Interse cookie stuff.

Both the debug-log-name and log-name parameters need to be edited to
reflect the final deployment log directory on the server.


2. Add the following entry as the very first Service entry in the
default Object section:

Service fn="DOLSwidCookie-service" method="(GET|HEAD)" type="text/html"


3. Add the following entry as the very first AddLeg entry in the
default Object section:

AddLog fn="DOLSwidCookie-log"
